emacs-curl
==========

This package provides CURL interface to Emacs.

It provides various functions to interact with external curl(1) program.  Currently, it support HTTP only, and provides several functions to handle HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE methods.

Asynchronous HTTP requests are not fully implemented yet.  I'm intending to implement it soon.

The original idea and some of codes are stealed from the g-client.  See also http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak/ .
